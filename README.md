### How it Works ?
    Organization Registration:
        Organizations that require food register on the website by providing essential details such as their name, contact information, address, and the types of food they need.
        They also specify the required quantity of food, frequency of donations (e.g., daily, weekly), and whether they accept vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or both types of food.

    Food Donation Process:
        Donors visit the website and access the interactive map interface, which displays markers for nearby donation organizations.
        Donors can filter the displayed organizations based on criteria such as location, types of food required, and whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian food is accepted.
        Upon finding a suitable organization, donors can click on the map marker to view detailed information about the organization's food requirements, contact details, and address.

    Communication:
        Donors can initiate communication with the organization directly from the map interface. Contact options may include email, phone, or an integrated messaging system.
        If the donor has surplus food that matches the organization's requirements, they can coordinate the donation details, such as the quantity of food available, pickup/delivery arrangements, and any specific instructions.

    Real-Time Updates:
        The website provides real-time updates on the availability of donation organizations and their current food requirements.
        Organizations can update their food requirements and availability directly on the platform, ensuring that donors have access to the most accurate information.

    User Profiles:
        Organizations and donors have the option to create user profiles, where they can manage their information, view donation history, and track communication with other users.

    Feedback Mechanism:
        Users can provide feedback on their donation experiences and suggest improvements for the platform, helping to enhance the overall user experience.
